abstract="Recent studies have shown that subgraphs of the head entity, such as related relations and neighborhoods, are helpful for Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR). However, prior studies tend to focus solely on enhancing entity representations using related relations, with little attention paid to the impact of different relations on different entities and their importance in various reasoning paths. Meanwhile, conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) utilized for KGR consider simultaneously neighboring nodes and connected relations of the head entity but typically use a standard message-passing paradigm over the entire Knowledge Graph (KG). This results in over-smoothed representations and limits efficiency. To address the above-mentioned limitations of existing methods, we propose a Dynamic Weighted Neural Bellman-Ford Network (DyNBF) for KGR, which utilizes relation weights generated from subgraphs to compute only the most relevant relations and entities. This way, we can integrate multiple reasoning paths more flexibly to achieve better interpretable reasoning, while scaling more easily to more complex and larger KGs. DyNBF consists of two key modules: 1) a transformer-based relation weights generator module, which computes the weights of different relations on the path with a sequence-to-sequence model, and 2) an NBFNet-based logic reasoner module, which obtains entity representations and conducts fact prediction with dynamic weights from the previous module. Empirical results on three standard KGR datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate explainable reasoning paths and obtain competitive performance.",
